# Emotion Recognition using EEG

### Introduction
Emotion recognition has significant applications in various fields, from psychology to human-computer interaction. Traditional methods such as facial expressions or physiological signals like heart rate and skin conductance have limitations due to potential inaccuracies (e.g., faked expressions, variability due to external factors). EEG (Electroencephalography) signals, however, offer a promising avenue as they directly reflect brain activity, which is less prone to alteration or error.

### Project Objective
This research project aims to explore the feasibility of recognizing emotions using EEG signals. The primary focus is on categorizing emotions—positive, negative, and neutral—using unsupervised learning techniques. The hypothesis is that EEG data, which captures brain signals, can provide more accurate and reliable indicators of emotional states compared to other modalities.

### Dataset
The project utilizes a pre-existing dataset labeled with three primary emotional categories: positive, negative, and neutral. These labels were assigned based on EEG recordings. The dataset is initially separated into three subsets corresponding to each emotional category.

### Methodology
Data Preparation: Separate the dataset into positive, negative, and neutral emotion categories.
Unsupervised Learning Techniques: Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to each subset to explore potential sub-categories or nuances within each emotional category.
Evaluation: Use metrics like silhouette score to assess the quality of clustering and potential sub-categorization within each emotional category.
Visualization: Visualize EEG data clusters to gain insights into how emotions manifest within each category.

### Challenges and Considerations
Interpretation: Interpreting clusters and their emotional significance requires domain expertise.
Ethical Considerations: Ensuring privacy and consent in using EEG data for emotional analysis.

### Future Directions
Future research could focus on:
Enhancing classification accuracy using advanced machine learning models.
Incorporating real-time EEG data for continuous emotion monitoring.
Validating results across diverse demographic and cultural groups.

### Conclusion
This project seeks to contribute to the field of emotion recognition by leveraging EEG signals for more reliable and accurate emotional categorization. By exploring unsupervised learning methods on labeled EEG datasets, it aims to provide insights into the potential of EEG-based emotion recognition systems.# Emotion-Recognition-using-EEG
